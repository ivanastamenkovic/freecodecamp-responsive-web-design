        <h1>Hi! I'm Ivana Stamenkovic</h1>
        <p>
          I've just finished a Responsive Web Design Certification on
          freeCodeCamp!

        <p>
          * the projects in the portfolio were done for the Responsive Web
          Design Certification on freeCodeCamp, as well as for the 100 Days of
          Code course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller*
        </p>
        <p>
          These projects were created as part of the course, with the primary
          goal of fulfilling the requirements outlined in the specifications for
          each individual project. As a result, not all functionalities are
          fully implemented, and the site may not display optimally on mobile
          devices or screens with significantly higher resolutions than
          standard.

                In order to receive the certification, I had to complete several
                projects (to fulfil the given user stories and pass all the
                tests). I gave a personal style to each project.

                This project focused on building and styling forms, exploring
                attributes like placeholders, rows, and more. It also covered
                best practices for accessibility and preventing design issues
                with form elements.

                This is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game project created as part
                of the 100 Days of Code course. It follows the course code but
                also includes several custom features and improvements that I
                added.
